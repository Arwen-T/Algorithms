## Algorithms

I'm trying my best to write functions in multiple languages for different algorithms, with explanations even though I am a beginner programmer in all langauges and I'm doing this mostly to learn.

## All algorithms made so far:

### Euclid's algorithm | In Python, Lua, JavaScript, Java, Rust, C++, C#, C
Given two positive integers m and n, find their greatest common divisor, that is, the largest positive integer that evenly divides both m and n.
