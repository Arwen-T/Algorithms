## Algorithms

I'm trying my best to write functions in multiple languages for different algorithms, with explanations. I am a beginning programmer and I'm doing this mostly to learn. I thought it would be nice to turn them into functions and upload them to github so I and other people can easily understand and use them later as well.

If there are any optimizations feel free to talk to me about it, since I'm a beginner in most of the langauges I will use on this repository, and I'm always willing to learn.

## All algorithms:

### Euclid's algorithm
Given two positive integers m and n, find their greatest common divisor, that is, the largest positive integer that evenly divides both m and n.
