# Algorithms
Different algorithms for different purposes, written in multiple languages

I'm trying my best to write functions in multiple languages for different algorithms, with explanations, all according to Donald E. Knuth's books; The Art of Computer Programming. I'm doing this mostly to learn, next to that, I thought it would be nice to turn them into functions and upload them to github so I and other people can easily understand and use them as well.

If there are any optimizations feel free to talk to me about it, since I'm a beginner in most of the langauges I will use on this repository, and I'm always willing to learn.
